use aerodynamic lift entry earths atmosphere employing aerodynamic lift entry earths atmosphere either orbital escape velocity range allowable entry angles prescribed peak deceleration greatly increased total heat energy transferred vehicle held value nonlifting vehicle modest liftdrag ratios required beyond peak g prevent deceleration exceeding peak value prevent vehicle skipping earths atmosphere thus difficult guidance control problem greatly alleviated particular return moon planets necessity multiplepass drag braking eliminated
