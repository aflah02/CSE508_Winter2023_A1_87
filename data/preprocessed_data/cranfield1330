fourier transforms theory nonstationary flows growth lift airfoil starting impulsively rest uniform velocity given wagner 1925 steadystate lift due circulation airfoil oscillating sinusoidally moving uniform velocity given theodorsen present paper based essentially material n c report 629 author discusses reciprocal relations nature fourier transforms existing functions wagner theodorsen kussner 1936 already shown wagners function may derived theodorsens function means superposition principle possible utilize fundamental functions treat general problems transient expression accurate within 2 percent given wagners function expression leads good approximate expression theodorsens function terms exponential integral instead hankel functions analogy drawn transient hydrodynamic flows transient electrical flows kussner 1936 introduced function describing growth lift airfoil entering sharp edged vertical gust region function bears certain relation wagners function briefly discussed
